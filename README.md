<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>

The purpose of this project was to refactor given code to increase accessibility by using semantic HTML. Semantic HTML uses meaninful tags to provide greater clarity to users and search engines about what is being presented. Instead of using tags such as div, tags such as header, section, and article are used.
